# CSS Flexbox & Grid for Refresh Savannah

The demo from my Refresh Savannah presentation on CSS flexbox and grid.

I used [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) to process the SCSS file (I feel horrible, but SCSS is just easier to read at this point), but any preprocessor will work.

It's just so people can grab it after the presentation and have it to keep for their very own.
